learning algorithms to provide short yet insightful predictions and 
analyses of NFL games. By using historical game 
data, the project aims to predict game outcomes as well as point totals while 
taking factors like home field advatage into account.

Additionally, it seeks to provide real-time analysis during games, 
enhancing the viewing experience, and offer predictive insights for sports betting markets. Through intuitive visualizations and community engagement, this project aspires to make NFL analytics more accessible, fostering a deeper understanding of the game and contributing to the evolving field of sports analytics.
