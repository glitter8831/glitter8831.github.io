<h1>  
    The displayed odds are derived from comprehensive data analysis 
    of the 2023 NFL season. We calculate average points scored and 
    given up for both home and away teams. A sophisticated logistic 
    regression model employs gradient descent to determine the optimal 
    weights for these inputs, which results in expected points for (XPF),
    expected points against (XPA), and accounts for home field 
    advantage. Subsequently, another logistic regression model 
    applies the sigmoid function to XPF and XPA to predict the 
    probability of the home team winning. The model's performance is 
    evaluated against actual game results, ensuring its reliability.
