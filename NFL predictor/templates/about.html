                    The primary goal of this project was to leverage machine  
                    learning algorithms to provide short yet insightful 
                    predictions and analyses of NFL games. By using historical 
                    game data, the project aims to predict game outcomes 
                    as well as point totals while taking factors like  
                    home field advatage into account.

                    To gather data on the 2023 NFL season, 
                    I utilized web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup, 
                    a powerful Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
                     The scraped data was cleaned and structured into a 
                     Pandas Dataframe, another useful python library. 
                     The well-structured data allowed for seamless integration 
                     into the machine learning models.

                    The first model used was scikit-learn's linear regression  
                    model. This model uses an advanced version of gradient 
                    descent to match the regression model with the data. After 
                    calculating the average points scored and allowed for all 
                    the teams, the linear regression model used these inputs to 
                    calculate the expected amount of points scored and allowed
                    given the opponent and the venue (home, away, or neutral).

                    The second model used was scikit-learnâ€™s logistic regression
                     model. As opposed to the linear model, the logistic model 
                     aims to predict a 1 (in our case a win) or a 0 (loss) 
                     given the expected points scored and expected points 
                     allowed. This model utilizes the sigmoid function to 
                     predict the likelihood a set of inputs results in a 1.

                    Z-score and normal 
                    distribution were used to calculate the probability of a 
                    team scoring and allowing a given amount of points. This 
                    involved retrieving the mean and standard deviation for 
                    the points scored and points allowed column of the dataset. 
                    For a given amount of points, the normal.cdf function was used to return the 
                    likelihood of a team scoring or allowing at least that many 
                    points.
